# Interactive Questionnaire for Designing Optimised Small-Plot Agricultural Trials

## Overview

The **Interactive Questionnaire for Designing Optimised Small-Plot Trials** is a tool created to help gather essential information from agricultural researchers to enable the design of **customised, optimised small-plot trial layouts** that meet the specific research aims, maximises statistical power, minimises bias, and provides a strong foundation for reliable data analysis.

Once researchers fill out the questionnaire, they can easily download their responses as a CSV file, which can then be shared for further processing and design work.

## Key Features

-   **Customised Trial Layouts**: The questionnaire collects all relevant information about the researcher’s trial, such as trial objectives, treatments, and other factors, allowing us to design a trial layout tailored to their needs.

-   **Optimised Statistical Power**: By understanding the specific details of the trial, we can design the layout to enhance statistical power and ensure the collection of valid, actionable data.

-   **CSV Download**: After completing the questionnaire, researchers can download their responses in CSV format, which they can easily email to us for trial design.

-   **Data-Driven Design**: The questionnaire helps us design trials that are not only methodologically sound but also aligned with the researcher’s research goals and conditions.

## Purpose

This tool is designed to:

-   Help agricultural researchers provide essential information that we need to design a customised small-plot trial layouts.

-   Ensure the trial layout is optimised for statistical power, data quality, and meaningful analysis.

-   Provide researchers with a tailored trial design that aligns with their specific objectives, ensuring reliable results.

## How It Works

1.  **Fill Out the Questionnaire**: Researchers complete the interactive questionnaire, providing detailed information about their trial, such as crop species, treatment conditions, trial objectives, experimental design preferences, and other relevant factors.

2.  **CSV File Download**: Once the questionnaire is completed, researchers can download their responses as a CSV file. This file contains all the input data in a structured format, making it easy to email the file to us.

3.  **Submit the CSV File**: Researchers email the downloaded CSV file to \[Your Consultancy Name\] for review. We will use this information to create a customized trial layout based on their needs.

4.  **Consultancy Design**: Based on the responses in the CSV file, our team will design a tailored trial layout that aligns with the researcher’s specific goals and ensures a strong foundation for effective data analysis.
